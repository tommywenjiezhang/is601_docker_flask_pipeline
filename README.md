## So How does it work?
Some definitions:
- Docker: a technology that package all the code and dependency into single container, allowing application to run from different computing environment
- Travis CI, a continuous integration platform automatically build and test code changes, providing immediate feedback on the success of the change. Travis CI can also automate other parts of your development process by managing deployments
- heroku a cloud platform host your app
